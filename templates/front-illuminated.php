                        Today Art Chazin is the leading company in the field of painting and creating original Jewish art on parchment. Included in this artwork is the Haggadah for Passover, written and drawn on parchment, the Megillat Esther, Jewish oil paintings and more.

                    <div class="info__descr-text p">The facsimile edition of the Illuminated Torah is limited to only 613 copies, the edition was skilfully and professionally produced by Avraham Chazin, who conducted the whole process of production for about a year and a half. The process of production for a book of such dimension is very complex and requires a lot of responsibility and professionalism.
                        The production process starts by scanning the original parchment pictures and comparing its colours to those of the original. This step of scanning is the most complex part of the process due to the fact that parchment seems to be alive and moving; it is wavy and therefore requires a special scanner. A team of professionals from Art Chazin were recruited for the graphic production of the project such as: proofreading of the calligraphic text, layout of the book, hand drawing of the engravings for the gold stamping and the preparation of the laser.
                        The book was printed on wood-free paper made especially for this project, impressive stamp gold was used on all of the drawings and the page preceding each episode is complimented with laser cuttings. At the end of this process the book was bound with leather binding.
                        The limited edition of the Illuminated Torah glorifies the homes of Judaica collectors around the world, prime ministers and Senators. It can be admired in various museums in the States and in the Yeshiva ‘Aish Hatorah’ http://www.aish.com/ at the Kotel.
                        The credits belonging to Art Chazin can be found on page 5 of the book. </div>

                    <div class="info__descr-text p">In the original edition of the book of Bereishis, Art Chazin participated with the drawings for most of the book, besides for just a small part of it which was done by a different team of artists. The difference in the level of painting can be noticed, the book was printed in a smaller version and marketed by the company ‘Artscroll’.

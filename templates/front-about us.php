                        Today Art Chazin is the leading company in the field of painting and creating original Jewish art on parchment. Included in this artwork is the Haggadah for Passover, written and drawn on parchment, the Megillat Esther, Jewish oil paintings and more. The company has gained a reputation among the world’s greatest Judaica collectors, pieces of "Art Chazin" have been shown at exhibitions around the world, and were purchased by highly discerning collectors for their beauty, originality and utmost attention to detail.</div>

                    <div class="about__descr-text">Our team is made up of 17 handpicked artists, guided by Avraham Chazin for several years, in order to produce the most magnificent and outstanding pictures of the highest level possible. These artists are extremely talented yet still totally dependent on the guidance and direction of Chazin. Before they can draw a scene, Chazin draws a sketch for them from which they can build the artwork. Avraham Chazin coaches them through every detail- every character, every movement and every colour scheme. This system enables Chazin to produce the final product, which is breathtakingly beautiful, and higher than any global standard.</div>
